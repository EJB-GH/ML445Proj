This project is the final assignment for the Machine Learning class as PSU, CS445

Dependancies:
torch
os
matplotlib
torchvision
scikit-learn

Overview:

Using this data set-> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marcopinamonti/alzheimer-mri-4-classes-dataset/data
We create two models, a basic Multi-Layer Perceptron, and a Convolutional Neural Network, with the understanding that the MLP will be outclassed by the CNN.
The point of the project is to explore a topic not covered in the class, and compare two models on the same topic to compare performance, and write a report on our findings
